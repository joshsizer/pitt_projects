EXTRA CREDIT:

This is able to evaluate:
pi as the same at Math.pi
sin
cos
tan
max
min
floor
ceil

It can also evaluate negative numbers. It cannot, however, evaluate any negation of functions.
For example, cos(-pi) evalutates correctly, but -cos(-pi) does not evaluate correctly.

All functions should appear as such: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), max(x, y), min(x,y), floor(x), ceil(x), where x and y are positive or negative doubles or expressions that evaluate to positive or negative doubles. Spaces do not matter.
